For this exam, I made a hologram effect and a scrolling effect on the walls of the map. The reason I did this was because I wanted to put a spin on the old Pac-Man and make a more futuristic almost cyberpunk kind of style for pac-man.

I achieve this, I applie a simple scrolling texture of just lines going accross the screen to recreate hologram strobing effect. I added transparency to the shader so that only the lines would show up and make it resemble a hologram more. However, because the game is still pac-man, the walls of the environment are very important to gameplay. I never wanted the walls to fully disappear because then the player wouldn't know where they can go, running into air is very frustrating. Additionally, I added an extra layer of noise on top of this shader. Straight lines are very boring... Adding this extra noise on top helps to make the environment look less mundane. The walls take up so much of your screen after all so it's important they remain interesting to the eye, but not be too distracting. Made this additional effect with two layers of noise, one bigger than the other and inverted, so then when its multiplied back togeter, I get thin lines instead of thick splotches.

Then to make the map look even more dynamic, I made a scrolling stars effect that runs beneath the map. I made it the same colors as regular pac-man so that it is still reminicent to the player. As long as I keep the speed of the stars slow, it wont be too distracting to the player and just serves as an additional dynamic element that makes the map feel alive. The stars is meant to tie the theme of it feeling futuristic by making you wonder if you're in space.

After these, I wanted to make the ghosts look cooler as well. To do this, I added this dissolving effect that makes the ghosts feel like a futuristic ghost. It discentagrates and looked intangable like a ghost but because it the dissolving is glowing and looks like metal rusting and falling off, the ghost perfectly fits in the theme as well. The effect also makes the bottom of the ghost look more like its meant to

Lastly I made this dither effect on Pac-man himself and made him glow a lot. This made him distinct from enemies and highlights the player. The dither effect almost looks like those cyberpunky billboards too because you can kind of see through it and it glows. All of it ties together with the cyberpunky futuristic theme.

I couldn't make a build because I was using a MacOS. I haven't made a build in it before but I talked to Dr.Alvaro
